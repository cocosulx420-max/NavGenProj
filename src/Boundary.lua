-- NavGen.Boundary — clean outlines from the local grids, by DESIGN.md's method.
--
-- The input is LocalGrid's per-part, part-aligned cell masks. The method is
-- DESIGN.md steps 3-5, 7 and 8: chain the boundary edges of a mask, grow a
-- best-fit line along the boundary cells while the MAXIMUM residual stays under
-- a cell, and take corners as the places where that fit failed.
--
-- THIS MODULE NEVER ASKS A PART ANYTHING. No CFrames, no face planes, no sizes,
-- no raycasts, no overlap queries. It reads cell centres and nothing else. That
-- is DESIGN.md's central rule and it is not an aesthetic one: a Union or a
-- MeshPart has no readable planar face, and interpenetrating parts report faces
-- that are not surfaces. An earlier version of this module took its lines from
-- the side planes of whichever part killed each cell. It was more accurate on
-- SmallMap -- and it is exactly the approach DESIGN.md records as having given
-- this project hell on real maps, so it is gone.
--
-- WHY THE FIT IS CHEAP HERE, WHICH IS THE POINT OF THE LOCAL GRIDS. On a
-- world-aligned raster every rotated part staircases, so the fit is doing heavy
-- reconstruction everywhere and its tolerance is load-bearing everywhere. On a
-- part-aligned grid the host's own rim already lies along whole lattice lines,
-- so the fit reproduces it with zero residual and has nothing to undo. What is
-- left for the fit is the genuinely hard case: the footprint of some OTHER part
-- crossing this one's lattice at an angle. Same method as DESIGN.md, applied to
-- a fraction of the edges, which is why the tolerances stop fighting.
--
-- SAFETY. The only morphology is erosion. Lines are biased inward (step 5) and
-- polygons are fitted to cell centres, so the boundary sits at or inside the
-- walkable cells and never outside them. Erosion can remove walkable ground but
-- can never invent connectivity, so no amount of it welds two rooms through a
-- wall. Nothing here dilates.

	stepTol: number?,

	-- STEP 4. The maximum perpendicular distance a boundary node may sit from
	-- its segment's line. A whole cell is too loose in practice: it lets a line
	-- run a stud clear of nodes it claims, which reads as the line ignoring
	-- them. Half a cell puts 223 -> 49 nodes over half a stud from the boundary
	-- for 21 more segments; tightening further buys nothing.
	fitTol: number?,

	-- STEP 8. Runs shorter than this are absorbed, and runs whose directions
	-- agree to within collinearDeg are merged -- both BEFORE corners are
	-- intersected, because short runs are what make an intersection unstable.
	minSegLen: number?,
	-- Two runs whose directions agree to within this are one run. Deliberately
	-- generous: Cocosulx would rather carry fewer, straighter edges than have the
	-- boundary kink by 14 degrees to chase a node.
	collinearDeg: number?,

	-- STEP 7. An acute corner throws two lines' intersection arbitrarily far
	-- out -- the classic miter spike. Past this distance from the corner it
	-- replaces, bevel across instead.
	miterLimit: number?,

	-- Pass one. The travel axis is named by the first axis to move twice in a
	-- row; `staircaseWindow` is only the fallback for a 45-degree rim, which
	-- alternates forever and never repeats. The run then ends on a travel
	-- reversal, a step reversal, or the run's fitted line getting more than
	-- `driftTol` cells from a node it already passed through. The first two are
	-- exact; `driftTol` is the only tolerance in pass one.
	staircaseWindow: number?,
	driftTol: number?,
	-- How many further nodes a run explores before believing a deviation.
	driftSpan: number?,

	-- A run shorter than `cornerSpan` sitting between two runs that turn through

	-- two meet properly.

-- PASS ONE — CORNERS, READ OFF THE STAIRCASE
--
-- See CORNERS.md. This is a WALK, not a per-node classifier, and the difference
-- is not cosmetic. A stateless version was tried: at every node, look back a
-- window for the travel axis and forward a few moves for a resumption. It failed
-- on half of all right-angle turns, and the reason is worth keeping written down.
--
-- When a run turns into a STAIRCASE, the new staircase's steps lie along the old
-- run's travel axis. So "did my travel axis move again?" keeps answering yes,
-- once every five or six moves, and the turn is forgiven. Measured on a labelled
-- run: a vertical run turning into a horizontal staircase was missed entirely,
-- and a false corner appeared two nodes later once the backward window had
-- filled with the new run's moves. One fault, both symptoms.
--
-- READING THE PATTERN IS A DEAD END, AND THIS IS THE THIRD TIME IT FAILED.
--
-- Counting steps, then bracketing steps, then measuring a stepping RATE. Each
-- looked structurally right and two measured as outright regressions. They share
-- one premise: that the arrangement of steps identifies the wall. It does not.
-- Two identical walls half a stud apart quantise differently, and an irregular
-- staircase is still a staircase -- so any rule reading cadence disagrees with
-- itself across a sub-cell offset, and the tolerance that hides the disagreement
-- also hides real turns. There is one knob and it trades recall against
-- precision monotonically.
--
-- THREE RULES, TWO OF THEM EXACT.
--
-- 1. TRAVEL SIGN IS FIXED. A horizontal run goes left or right, never both.
-- 2. STEP SIGN IS FIXED. Its steps go up or down, never both.
-- 3. The run may not DRIFT from its own average heading.
--
-- The first two need no tolerance, so they are checked first -- a reversal is
-- proof, and there is no reason to let a threshold weigh in on something already
-- decided. Rule 3 is the only tolerance in pass one and exists solely for the
-- rim that turns WITHOUT reversing, which is the shallow-angle case.
--
-- Rule 1 is not a formality. DESIGN.md step 4 records it discovered from the
-- other side, as a bug: rounding the end of a thin strip brings the walk back
-- down the other side, every returning cell sits within tolerance of the line it
-- just left, so the residual NEVER fails -- 36 of SmallMap's step parts collapsed
-- entirely until a travel-direction test was added in pass two. Drift alone is
-- blind to every one of those. It is cheaper to catch here.
--
-- THE TRIGGER IS NOT THE CORNER. All three rules only answer "the run is over".
-- None of them says where the corner is: the corner is the LAST TRAVEL MOVE,
-- walked back to. This is the whole difference from the fit-failure corners
-- CORNERS.md rejects, which let the residual failure BE the corner and so landed
-- a node early and left a chamfer in the crook. On a skim the two look alike.

	-- longer closes the wall. That is what makes the classification's grit
	-- harmless instead of fatal: 79% of class runs on this map are one or two
	-- nodes, and previously every one of them forced a break that step 8 could
	-- never undo.
	--
	-- But a line may not EXPAND INTO foreign nodes either. If it could, a wall
	-- run would happily leap the seam nodes across a doorway and seal it, which
	-- is the one thing that invents connectivity. So a foreign stretch longer
	-- than `maxGap` ends the run: a speck is ignored, a real stretch is a

	-- that happens to meet.
